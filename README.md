# Ropes-Data-structure
# Rope Data Structure Implementation in C++

A comprehensive implementation of the Rope data structure in C++ for efficient string manipulation operations.

## What is a Rope?

A Rope is a binary tree data structure used for efficiently storing and manipulating very large strings. Unlike traditional string representations that store characters in a contiguous array, a Rope stores string data in the leaves of a binary tree, making operations like concatenation, insertion, and deletion much more efficient for large strings.

## Features

- **Efficient String Operations**: O(log n) complexity for most operations
- **Balanced Tree Structure**: Automatically creates balanced trees for optimal performance
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores actual string data in leaf nodes
- **Interactive Interface**: Command-line interface for testing all operations

## Operations Supported

1. **Insert**: Insert a string at any position
2. **Delete**: Remove a substring between specified indices  
3. **Concatenate**: Join two ropes together
4. **Split**: Split a rope at a specified index
5. **Search**: Find character at a specific index
6. **Print**: Display the entire rope content
7. **Report**: Extract a substring between specified indices

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Insert    | O(log n)       | O(log n)         |
| Delete    | O(log n)       | O(log n)         |
| Concatenate| O(1)          | O(1)             |
| Split     | O(log n)       | O(log n)         |
| Search    | O(log n)       | O(1)             |
| Report    | O(log n + k)   | O(k)             |

*where n is the length of the string and k is the length of the extracted substring*

## Usage

### Compilation

```bash
g++ -o rope rope.cpp
```

### Running the Program

```bash
./rope
```

### Example Usage

```
Enter the initial string for the rope: Hello World

Current rope content: Hello World
Length: 11

Choose an operation:
1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Concatenate
4. Split
5. Search
6. Print
7. Report (Extract Substring)
8. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter the string to insert: Beautiful 
Enter the position to insert at: 6
String inserted successfully.

Current rope content: Hello Beautiful World
Length: 21
```

## Code Structure

### Main Components

- **RopeNode**: The basic node structure containing:
  - `value`: String data (for leaf nodes)
  - `weight`: Total length of left subtree
  - `left`/`right`: Child node pointers

- **Core Functions**:
  - `createRope()`: Creates a balanced rope from a string
  - `split()`: Splits rope at specified index
  - `concatenate()`: Joins two ropes
  - `insert()`: Inserts string at position
  - `erase()`: Removes substring
  - `search()`: Finds character at index
  - `report()`: Extracts substring

### Key Features

- **Automatic Balancing**: Creates balanced trees during rope creation
- **Weight Management**: Maintains accurate weights for efficient operations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup with `deleteRope()` function
- **Error Handling**: Bounds checking and exception handling

## Advantages of Rope Data Structure

1. **Efficient Concatenation**: O(1) time complexity
2. **Efficient Insertion/Deletion**: O(log n) vs O(n) for arrays
3. **Memory Efficient**: No need to copy entire strings
4. **Scalable**: Performance doesn't degrade with string size
5. **Persistent**: Can maintain multiple versions efficiently

## Use Cases

- **Text Editors**: Efficient text manipulation for large documents
- **Version Control**: Managing different versions of text
- **String Processing**: When frequent insertions/deletions are needed
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users editing the same document
- **Undo/Redo Operations**: Maintaining operation history

## Implementation Details

- **Threshold**: Uses 8 characters as threshold for leaf nodes
- **Balancing Strategy**: Splits strings at midpoint during creation
- **Weight Calculation**: Recursively calculates and updates node weights
- **Memory Safety**: Proper deallocation to prevent memory leaks

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++)
- C++11 or later

### Build Commands
